[A blog](https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms/free-blog-maker?hubs_post-cta=&hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog&hubs_content-cta=A%20blog&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog) is typically a section of [your business's website](https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms/drag-and-drop-website-builder?hubs_post-cta=&hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog&hubs_content-cta=your%20business%27s%20website&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog) — but, unlike the rest of your website, you need to update the blog section frequently by adding new posts. Additionally, your blog is a tool that allows you to engage more with an audience, either by analyzing how many readers share your blog posts on social, or by allowing readers to comment on your individual posts. In this way, a blog is more like a two-way conversation than the rest of your website. However, a blog can also be an entire website, and often is, if the blog is for personal use alone — for instance, a travel blog.

"There are plenty of benefits to blogging — it helps drive traffic to your website, it enables you to better convert that traffic into leads, it allows your business to establish authority in an industry, and it continues to help your business grow and attract new customers months and even years after publication." https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog

"For businesses, a blog is a valuable tool to have in your marketing strategy. It’s a great way to get the word out about your brand and build rapport with your audience and potential customers.Use it to provide your audience with useful industry-related information, share company news, and product updates. Blog content is also easy to repurpose for email marketing needs and across social channels. Without one, you’re missing out on opportunities to promote your brand.Creating engaging blog content may seem like a heavy lift at first. Luckily there are free tools like HubSpot’s AI Content Writer to help you write better content faster." https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog
